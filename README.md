# DarkTech
Engine mod of Cube 2 Engine: Sauerbrate Collect Edition

This is my personal Cube 2 Engine modification that I called Dark Tech
(Because it was started when I was part of Darkware Team doing the Beta
for the Nejbet Competition 2011 ). The engine has around of 95% of the original
code from Cube 2 Engine Collector Edition. The rest of the code was added to
improve the feature of SQLite database interaction allowing to the developers
make achievements in the game and to players to save their progress
